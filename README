! Gloomhaven scenario graph

This project allows you to create a graph showing how the scenarios you have played in Gloomhaven fit together.

After playing a scenario, update the details in scenario_dag.py:

* Add the scenario to the 'completion_dict' with details of completion date etc.
* Add any unlocked scenarios to 'scenarios' either in one of the scenario blocks or to the `other_scenarios` list.
* Add edges to link the completed scenario to unlocked scenarios using the `add_edge` function

Then run the script to create and open the graph:

`python scenario_dag.py`

This will require certain packages to be available. I have set up a conda environment with them, called `graphics` so you can use:

`conda activate graphics`

After taking screenshots of the images and storing them in separate files `locations/raw/locations_<i>.png`, you can resize them using the script `locations/alter_images.sh`.
